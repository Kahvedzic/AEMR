# American Energy Market Regulator (SQL and Tableau)

Project Summary:

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the reliability of the USA's domestic energy network, minimizing disruptions known as outages. Of the four types of outages, the AEMR penalizes only forced outages, as they can threaten network reliability if energy supply cannot meet demand. Recently, the AEMR has noted an increase in outage submissions for 2016 and 2017. The management team has two primary concerns, energy stability and market outages, and energy losses and market reliability. As an analyst, you are tasked with addressing these concerns by using SQL and Tableau to extract and analyze relevant data, answering queries, and providing additional insights for the management team.

# Part 1. AEMR SQL Case Study (SQL Jupyter Notebook)
- COUNT(*) :Counted all outages by year and month
- AVG: Calculated Average outage duration per plant, per year
- SQL Filtering
- Identified high risk plants

# Part 2. AEMR Tableau Case Study

Project Summary:

ChemCorp, a leading chemical producer, has experienced strong market demand, averaging 7% annual growth, leading to expansions across 48 states. Despite this, increased competition from startups using advanced technologies like machine learning and AI has become a concern. Five long-term customers, representing about 10% of sales revenue, have recently switched providers, prompting ChemCorp to take immediate action. A team from Commercial, Strategy, and Business Analytics was formed to address this issue and prevent further market share loss, which could undermine management's credibility and affect dividend payments. ChemCorpâ€™s portfolio includes six industries (Aerospace Defence, Biotechnology, Machinery and Industrial Goods, Medical Equipment, Paper and Packaging, Pharmaceuticals) and eleven chemical products (including specialty chemicals A, G, and J). Management's high-level problem statement is focused on preventing future market share loss by identifying growth industries and potential divestment products.
